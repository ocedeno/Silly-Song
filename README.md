# Silly Song

**Summary:**

This application was created purposely for the [Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com). This project firmed up my knowledge on creating an application that allows users to add their name into a silly song.

**The application offers the following features:**

* Create a silly song based off the user's first name.

**Technologies Used In Application:**

* UITextField
* UICollectionViews
* MVC
* Swift
* String Interpolation
*String/Character Type Manipulation


**Testing The App:**

* Download the project to your computer from this project page.
* Once the project is downloaded, open the .xcodeproj file from the folder.
* Run the project either using the iPhone simulator or your device. I recommend running the project on the latest iPhone device. It should be compiled with the latest version of Xcode.
* If you choose to download it on your device, please plug in your device to your computer and make the device target your device model. Then click 'run'.

**Closing:**

In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project. I am confident that I mastered UIKit, UITextField, and management of different types and am able to successfully create applications using navigation, along with additional libraries..
